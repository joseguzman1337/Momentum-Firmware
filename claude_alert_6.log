Excellent! The fix has been applied successfully. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed **Code Scanning Alert #6** - the format string vulnerability in `applications/main/nfc/scenes/nfc_scene_mf_ultralight_unlock_warn.c` at line 26.

### What was the issue?

The code was passing a user-controlled string directly as the format string parameter to `nfc_text_store_set()`:

```c
nfc_text_store_set(nfc, furi_string_get_cstr(password_str));  // UNSAFE
```

This is a **format string vulnerability** because:
- `nfc_text_store_set()` is a variadic function that uses `vsnprintf()` internally
- If the password string contained format specifiers like `%s`, `%x`, `%n`, etc., they would be interpreted as format codes
- This could lead to information disclosure, crashes, or other undefined behavior

### The fix

Changed line 26 to use a constant format string `"%s"` and pass the dynamic content as an argument:

```c
nfc_text_store_set(nfc, "%s", furi_string_get_cstr(password_str));  // SAFE
```

This approach:
- Uses a constant, trusted format string (`"%s"`)
- Treats the user-controlled data as a string argument, not as format specifiers
- Matches the secure pattern used elsewhere in the codebase (e.g., `nfc_protocol_support.c:689`)

The fix is minimal, secure, and follows the existing codebase patterns.
