# RTL8814AU DriverKit Driver for macOS Sequoia

Experimental DriverKit-based user-space network driver scaffold for RTL8814AU USB 802.11ac adapters (e.g. Alfa AWUS1900) on macOS Sequoia.

This is a **stub only**: it does not yet implement a working Wi‑Fi data path. It is intended as a starting point for development and experimentation.
