## Description
# What's new

- Support for the Indala 224 LFRFIF Protocol (code adapted from Indala 26, based on Proxmark3). This should resolve #2386 (as well as hopefully provide some groundwork for later implementing Indala 64)

# Verification 

- **THIS IS WHERE I NEED HELP** 😃. I don't actually have access to such a card (yet...in the process), so I would need some help in seeing whether the functionality is correct. I've verified it to the point where the code builds and can be accessed like other protocols, but haven't been able to verify functionality

# Checklist (For Reviewer)

- [ ] PR has description of feature/bug or link to Confluence/Jira task
