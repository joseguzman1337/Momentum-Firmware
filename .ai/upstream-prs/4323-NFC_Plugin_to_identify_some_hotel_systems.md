## Description
# What's new

- A plugin for NFC to show the name of some systems based on known keys.  I got a bunch of hotel cards from my dad and wanted to categorize them, but realized the flipper didn't show this basic info, even though we know it.

# Verification 

- Scan an Onity, Saflok, or Vingcard NFC Mifare Classic and you'll see that it matches that.
