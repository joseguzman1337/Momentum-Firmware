## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Hi,
I am trying to get a read from a keyfob, but it doesnt read, only raw file.
Could you take a look?

[RfidRecord.ask.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22296602/RfidRecord.ask.txt)
[RfidRecord.psk.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22296601/RfidRecord.psk.txt)

I changed the .raw file to .txt, i dont know if this is the correct way.
