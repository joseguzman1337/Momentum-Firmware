## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

When navigating a large library of NFCs organized by directories, when I go back (up one level in the directory structure) I want it to have the directory I was just in selected instead of starting the selection at the top of the screen. 

The user work flow is to go into a directory, use a NFC file, go up to a higher level directory, press down one time, and select to go into the next directory in the list. 

I should be able to repeat this procedure in order to go through all directories in order without having to scroll down all the way from the top to get into the next directory each time.

This could and should be the default behavior for all file browsers but is evident to me in the NFC App when trying to cycle through multiple NFC files organized by directory name.

### Anything else?

Fixing the file navigation so that it remembers the directory or file you were in when returning to the navigation will make going through long lists of IR remotes and NFCs much easier and fewer clicks to navigate.
