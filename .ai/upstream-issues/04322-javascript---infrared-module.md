## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

This would be a new module for the JS engine that allows the script to send (maybe receive?) IR commands through the built-in infrared LED (/receiver)

### Anything else?

Not sure if it's out of scope (Sub-GHz isn't there either) but I haven't found if anybody filled this request earlier so here hoes nothing.

Thank you for your work and really good documentation btw
