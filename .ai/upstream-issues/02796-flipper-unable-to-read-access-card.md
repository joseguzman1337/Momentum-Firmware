## Description

### Describe the bug.

I have an access card for work that I have tried to read, its RFID and I have been only able to read the Raw data, I'm unsure how to view this or what to do with it and I've read I can report it as an issue that maybe one of you can help, it would be really appreciated if you could as I'd like to reproduce this as a key fob rather than card.
