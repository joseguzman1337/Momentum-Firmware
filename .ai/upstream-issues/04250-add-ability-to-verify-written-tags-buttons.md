## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Would it be possible to add a new menu entry for all modes of operation to allow verifications of IDs (written data)? 

Or maybe for saved entries, have a new menu option to verify ID/data and it would verify that the selected entry has the same data as the RFID,iButton, NFC card(s) being read. 

You basically select a saved entry and then you have a new menu called "Verify" which let's you verify the data with the original tag/card or you can use it to verify that the card you've just written is valid .. or if you have multiple cards and you don't know which is which you can use this to quickly find a specific tag/card.

### Anything else?
