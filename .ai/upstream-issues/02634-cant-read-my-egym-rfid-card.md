## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Hello,

I tried to read my EGYM (Fitness club) RFID card in order to clone to the ring or bracelet but failed. 
[Fit123.psk.raw.zip](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/files/11398251/Fit123.psk.raw.zip)

Could you please analyze it and add it, if possible, for the upcoming releases? These EGYM machines are getting popular and I guess people will be interested in such capabilities.

Thanks!

### Anything else?
