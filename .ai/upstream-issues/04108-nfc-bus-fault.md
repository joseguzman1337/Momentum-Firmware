## Description

### Describe the bug.

Hello, 
when I select an already saved NFC file and try to write to the original card, I get this error message. I
get this message with any NFC file and card. I should mention that before, 
I didn't have this error message and everything worked fine.



### Reproduction

1 NFC
2 SAVED
3 SELECT ONE
4 WRITE TO INITIAL CARD

### Target

_No response_

```

### Anything else?
