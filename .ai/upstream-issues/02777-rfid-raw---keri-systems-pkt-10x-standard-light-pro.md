## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Would love it if you could implement this RFID tag.

They are the key tag our area uses to allow us to get into the mail and laundry room and pool.

We only get 1, and if we lose it we have to pay $50 for a replacement.  Would rather just clone it and keep the original safe.
