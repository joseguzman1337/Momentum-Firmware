## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Please create a favorites API for adding parts of particular apps-- for example, I would like a unified favorites screen with my most-used picopass cards (and would be great if I could shoot right into "emulate x card" instead of having to go through 5 button presses), IR remotes, and NFC cards.

Ideally, if you could trigger a shortcut creation menu by long-pressing on a menu item in an app, then let me choose which shortcut screen to deposit that action on.  Even cooler still, let me schedule the action to a time or event-- like open X favorites menu when I am at a certain location on my phone.

Anyway, thanks for considering.  Picopass dev on discord said he would consider implementing this if there was an API!
