## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Legic Prime is a standard similar to Mifare and it is common in europe.

It would be helpful to be able to read and emulate the legic prime cards just like mifare.

(The algorithm is also available in the Proxmark3 source code, like the Mifare one)

### Anything else?

The flipper project is really interesting. Legic Prime support would make it a lot more practical.
