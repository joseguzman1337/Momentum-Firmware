## Description

### Describe the bug.

Hello. NFC emulation has not been working since version 0.94.1. I updated to the latest versions, formatted it many times, tried software such as unleashed, Xtreme, RogueMaster but the result did not change. My NFC card that I use for the apartment only works in version 0.94.1.

I reintroduce the card, it registers the card without giving any errors but it does not emulate. Does anyone have any ideas?
