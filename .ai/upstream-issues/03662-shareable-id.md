## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

The flipper zero has a built in id to it, why not have the ability to share with NFC, and then recognize friends over subGHZ chat? Please consider this feature.

### Anything else?

Maybe have the ability to have a display name (not the default ID), and a very short description.
