## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Bought a smart lock ROTHULT made by IKEA, which uses st25ta 14443A cards for access. 
Currently it is not possible to emulate these cards with a Flipper.  

It is possible to read/emulate them, and to extract the password using a Proxmark3 in standalone mode by touching the lock itself, thereby making a copy of the master card*. It would be great if something similar could be done on the Flipper.
