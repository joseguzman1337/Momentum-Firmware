## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

It would be great if you could make different Hopper_frequency presets.
And instead of the ON and OFF switch, you choose a preset.



### Anything else?

You can even limit their number and leave them in the setting_user file.

Maybe something like this:
Hopper_frequency_preset1, Hopper_frequency_preset2, Hopper_frequency_preset3

```
Hopper_frequency_preset1: 300000000
Hopper_frequency_preset1: 330000000
Hopper_frequency_preset1: 360000000

Hopper_frequency_preset2: 400000000
Hopper_frequency_preset2: 430000000
Hopper_frequency_preset2: 460000000
```
