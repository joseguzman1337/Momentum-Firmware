## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Currently flipper zero(Universal Remote Feature) sends a bunch of standardized codes for power on, power off, volume up/down etc....
I think for those who have lost their remotes, it would be easier to save and replay previous signals instead of having to redo the whole process to be able to replay the signals that work with their device.

### Anything else?
