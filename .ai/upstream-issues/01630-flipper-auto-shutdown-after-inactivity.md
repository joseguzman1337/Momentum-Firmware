## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

An inactivity auto-shutdown feature would be nice to have to prevent the battery from running down after being left on for days. 

Having a customizable auto-shutdown inactivity timer available in the Flipper settings menu would be ideal in order to help prevent the battery from totally discharging while flipper is stored out of sight in a drawer :)
