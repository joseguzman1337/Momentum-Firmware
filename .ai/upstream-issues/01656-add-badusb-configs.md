## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

With the badusb keyboard layouts PR there's a config menu with selectable keyboard layout configs. It would be nice to do the same thing but with vid,pid,manf,serial configs so you don't have to do it on a script by script hard edit basis and could do it on the fly. It would also be nice if you could have in your badusb assets folder a copy of the linux foundations 20k vid/pid database random vid/pid selector and randomly generate a manf/serial mode as well.

### Anything else?
