## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Many apps are using their own file types. It would be nice to have an option to include the file types into the Favorites menu. 
- registration of file suffix
- map it to an app that can open the file type
- assign a custom icon to the file type

I've seen custom firmware manually including different file types for the favorites menu (or app/main/archive). It would be cool if there was a dynamic way of doing this. Like a field in the apps manifest that allows to suggest an app to be the opener of a specific file type. 

### Anything else?
