Hi, I tried reading a RFID "Pill" used for production lots, but I was not able to do it. The attached specification sheet, mentions usage ISO 11784 and ISO 11785 compliance and the signal should be at 134,2khz. So it should be very similar to the animal RFID. Right now I´m not able to read it, even though the Flipper is blinking yellow...
Maybe you can look into it? Thank you very much in advance!

### Anything else?
