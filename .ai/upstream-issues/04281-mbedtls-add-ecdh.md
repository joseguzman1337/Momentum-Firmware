## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

This is like https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues/4009

I'd love it if the ECDH part of the mbedtls library were exposed.  This would allow PACE eMTRD(passport) support, and the ability to talk to PIV credentials

### Anything else?
