## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Asking for a feature where the HID Bluetooth Mouse Clicker would have a minimum value setting of "0" to enable a no-wait click, or the most minimal wait (ie. 1ms) if a true no-wait loop would cause the flipper to logically freeze.

thanks...  I might look at handling this request myself, but I'm not comfortable yet.

### Anything else?
