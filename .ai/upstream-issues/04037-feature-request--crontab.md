## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Hey, I talked about this with WillyJL and Aleksandr Kutuzov on Discord. 

In short, it's the ability to run an app or service in the background. It could be used to:
- start apps or run scripts at specific times
- ability to start apps in the background
- schedule an app or service to run in the background
- frequent battery status checks in FindMyFlipper app
- push notifications in FlipSocial

Willy mentioned a method `furi_cron_schedule() `



### Anything else?
