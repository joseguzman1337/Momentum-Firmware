## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

For analyzing a live RFID / NFC system it would be very helpful to know what the reader did during emulation. E.g. in Mifare systems usually the reader only tries to read a single card sector, using one of the two keys. 

It would be tremendously helpful if Flipper could show a human-readable log of these actions after user ended the emulation of a card. 

### Anything else?
