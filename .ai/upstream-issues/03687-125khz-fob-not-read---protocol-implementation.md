## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Hi,

Flipper cannot read a T5577 fob used for gate access. 

The fob in itself is completely generic

Attached are ASK/PSK raw reads.

Any help in decoding is welcome and appreciated if doable!

I have some additional fobs I can raw read if necessary to have multiple reads here.. 

Thanks

### Anything else?
