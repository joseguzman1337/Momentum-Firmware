## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

It would be nice to write info from an NFC Tag to another NFC Tag or have another option to delete something from an nfc tag(wipe nfc tag) . Is that possible?

### Anything else?

Maybe it would be nice to be able to override the old nfc codes
