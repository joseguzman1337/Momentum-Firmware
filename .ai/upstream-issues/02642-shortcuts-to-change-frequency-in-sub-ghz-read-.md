## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Right now SubGHz Read places FZ in read mode with left key to go to config, leaving other buttons unused. Up/Down could be Freq+ and Freq- and right could cycle through modulation. I think it will make it more user friendly. Possible?

### Anything else?
