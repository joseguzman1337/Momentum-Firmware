# Issue #4253: Adding a JS command to directly exit the application

## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.


I think a nice option would be to add a command that directly exits the JS application. Currently, after completing a script, we go to the console view, and to exit it, we have to press Back. The new command could directly exit to the application menu (bypassing the console view).

### Anything else?
