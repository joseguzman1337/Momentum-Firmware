# Issue #2859: NFC: Copy tag content to empty tags instead of initial card

## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Is it possible to write a saved nfc tag to a new empty tag. This way I can make several tags with the same data content. Now you can only write to the initial card. Some systems don’t look at the uid, but look at the data content.

### Anything else?

_No response_
