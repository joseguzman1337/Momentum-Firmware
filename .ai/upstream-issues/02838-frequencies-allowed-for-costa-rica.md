## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

As can be read here: [http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?nValor1=1&nValor2=53219](url), Art. 7, there are no reserved frequencies in the space of 433AM which most of the controllers work around the country. This frequency is not even reserved for AM broadcast. 

Another thing here: [http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?param1=NRTC&nValor1=1&nValor2=65675&nValor3=94853&strTipM=TC](url), Addendum VII, and here [http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?nValor1=1&nValor2=53219](url), Art. 37, there is no need to validate the device or ask for bandwidth when using less than 200mW (no external antena) or 2W (external antena), less than 200 meters radius and less than 24dBm transmitting power since they will be 'sporadic' transmissions.

I know legal stuff and regulations is a whole thing and I might not be correct, but this is my shot to use any remote in Costa Rica and start learning as I did some time ago in my university.

Thanks.
