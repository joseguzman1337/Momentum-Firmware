## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Today I was must leave my FZ at home (for 10 hours). After I come home, I hear my FZ beeping (alarm set to 07:00, I was return at 17:02). Alarm need these improvements and features:

1.) when user not dismiss alarm after X minutes, set repeat alarm after X minutes, do not beep & vibrate fulltime. Today my FZ run alarm for 10 hours constantly, and drained more than 40% of battery.

2.) when alarm is set, run alarm on phone too (app). Or add function to synchronize phone alarms with FZ?

3.) on locked FZ I see active animation, not a reason of beeping - need to show alarm screen when FZ is locked + there was visible icon of active app, not an alarm icon (maybe irrelevant)

4.) on alarmscreen is actual time, but not visible time of alarm set (important for snooze function)

5.) you cannot dismiss alarm on lockscreen by any way, only by restart or unlock - may be annoying for unexperienced pplz (like my parents for example). 

6.) snooze function is missing at all (for example default for 5 mins)

7.) cannot set, dismiss, snooze or set alarm easily via app

8.) no visible information about future (current set) alarm in app

9.) there are no instructions on alarmscreen - for future - right/left/up/down/center = snooze, back = dismiss alarm

10.) possible to add more/custom melodies? 

11.) lockscreen - enter password, it's annoying that display flashes until a password is entered. Same situation when app is opened via app. There is no info about active alarm on remote control. App is working, but FZ is flashing, vibrating, beeping.

12.) settings - C&A - alarm - currently u can set on/off, add one time function



### Anything else?

Thanks for any improvements. Have a nice day.
