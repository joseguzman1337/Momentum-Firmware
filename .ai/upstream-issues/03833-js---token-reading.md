## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

It's possible, to add a commands for JavaScript for reading/get tokens ID's? I mean, any. SubGHz, RFID, NFC, ... . 

This function will help me and my colleagues to make  our work much & much faster.  In my case - use it to scan all new orders of tokens to system (NFC, RFID, iButton, for now, we are typing all ID's by hand, which cause mistakes from time to time). Then JS just send ID as a keyboard to PC. Of course, I will need to use JS to transform ID to different format. Manufacturer FDI write ID like 01AB34CD, but Flipper read it as CD34AB01. 

Of course, I was try to search for possible commands in Flipper's JS, if these functions are implemented, then please sorry (send me a link). If not, it's possible to make a solution? Flipper with JS but without ability to return token ID is just a waste of anything. But.. If Flipper can do this, it will make Flipper more customizable and usable.

Please, leave any comments, ask any questions. 

PS: big thanks to anyone, who constructively helps to make Flipper better ♥️
