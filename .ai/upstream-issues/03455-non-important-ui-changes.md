## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

Some non-important ideas for make FZ a bit better. 

After a uSD card is removed without unmount procedure, show warning message, or better, message with sad Flipper image. After remove uSD card with unmount procedure, show notice, or notice with happy Flipper (educational way to always use unmount).

Unmount uSD card - allow to link Fav App button to this function, or, on dev FW's add function to FZ info screen (on desktop long press down). On FZ info just again long press down for legal unmount.

Power off - for now a sad Flipper is shown. After power on, add a happy Flipper screen. On dev FW's disable sad Flipper, or add a "working" Flipper. 

Settings - LCD and notifications - LED Brightness - on hover on this - turn on LED and leave it on until row is changed, and allow user to properly verify LED brightness. On "Vibro" - when set "ON", turn on vibration for at least one second (or apply two short vibrates). Current vibro time on set on is so short.

Settings - System - Date Format: option "D/M/Y" is not good. Slashes are used on US "M/D/Y". Please change "D/M/Y" to "D.M.Y" for make date format exact.

Many thanks for any comments, fixes, ... . :)
