# Issue #1038: Feature Request: i2c and SPI bridge to USB

## Description

Similarly to the USB-UART bridge, it'd be really useful to have an option to use flipper as a i2c device (Ideally both as a master and a slave that shares the memory to the host computer). Similarly a SPI Bridge option would be useful.
