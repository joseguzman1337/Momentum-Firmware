## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Currently, it's easy for EDR to detect a Flipper Zero. It would be really nice if a stealth mode could be configured in which USB and Bluetooth connections can set to use custom VID & PID and MAC addresses. This way EDR detection could hopefully be bypassed. 

### Anything else?
