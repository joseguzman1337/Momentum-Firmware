## Description

### Describe the enhancement you're suggesting.

- Current:
The mouse clicker cps value selection goes from 1 to 60 in 1cps increments

- Issue:
not sure if there is real value for the granular selection change of 1cps increment.  (I understand this is probably more of an example app)

- Change:
Where the value selection could go 1 to 5 to 10 to 15, etc... 
Or maybe 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64?

### Anything else?

thank you
