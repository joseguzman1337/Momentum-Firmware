## Description

### Describe the bug.

RFID card is not recognized by Flipper Zero. The card has no markings or brandings, so I can't really check what kind of technology that is, but the reader operaties at 134,2 KHZ and the technology is called TIRIS. Brand of reader is Tiprox PR64. See also the raw RFID readings.
