## Description

### Description of the feature you're suggesting.

Currently automatic screen lock will not be inhibited when Flipper is connected from e.g. qFlipper or PuTTY via USB CDC. This gets annoying when I need to manage files or use the console.

Most scenes seem to inhibit screen lock already so it's probably not needed to introduce an entirely new feature.

### Anything else?
