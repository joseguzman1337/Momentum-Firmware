# Issue #4104: Question regarding (non)consistency of blocking/internal animation manifests

**Original Issue:** [https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues/4104](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues/4104)

## Description

The [manifest](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/assets/dolphin/blocking/manifest.txt) of ***blocking animations*** shows all entries data to 0 (butthurt/lvl/weight) as those are meant to be called by their NAME when event occurs.
So I was wondering why it wasn't the same regarding the ***internal animations*** [manifest](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/assets/dolphin/internal/manifest.txt) where the listed anims too are meant to be called by NAME on specific event.
As far as I understand it, this doesn't seem to have any impact but in terms of **consistency** it seems a bit off to me especially when in the [readme](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/assets/dolphin/ReadMe.md) you have this being written :

Now, I might be missing something or even being totally wrong as my coding knowledge is pretty low... awaiting your enlightment if ever !
