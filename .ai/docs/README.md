# AI Documentation

Central documentation for the AI agent ecosystem.

See individual agent directories for detailed documentation.

### Core AI Technologies and Focus Areas

**1. Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)**

- **LLMs/Generative AI:** Extensive knowledge and experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 3 and GPT-4.
- **GenAI Infrastructure:** Building a proxy-first "AI Gateway" intermediary layer and a unified API endpoint to abstract LLM complexities for centralized control and security.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Deep experience with multi-agent systems, agent-to-agent (A2A) communication, and orchestration frameworks.

**2. AI/ML Security and Validation**

- **AI Security:** Securing AI and Machine Learning (ML) pipelines from development to runtime.
- **ML Security Solutions:** Deploying and operationalizing solutions like **Prisma AIRS**, which includes **AI Model Scanning** and **AI Red Teaming**.
- **Adversarial ML:** Direct experience in AI security, including adversarial ML techniques.

**3. Machine Learning and Data Science**

- **MLOps:** Hands-on experience with the ML operational lifecycle.
- **Frameworks:** Proficiency in frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.
- **Data Research:** Performing data-driven research on big data platforms.

**4. Foundation Model and Research (e.g., xAI)**

- **Foundation Models:** Working on world models, multimodal understanding (visual/audio), and pre-training infrastructure.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Focus on RL for coding agents, computer control, and RL training frameworks.
- **Synthetic Data:** Expertise in synthetic data & epistemics, sometimes referred to as Grokipedia.
- **Reasoning:** Roles focusing on reasoning efficiency and alignment.

**5. AI Technologies**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Used in roles such as patent agent and for designing and developing AI solutions.
- **GenAI Observability:** Experience building and maintaining highly observable GenAI systems, including proficiency with tracing and evaluation tools like **LangSmith**, **Arize**, and **HoneyHive**.
