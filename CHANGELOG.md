### Massive Submodule & Fork Synchronization (Dec 2025)
- Synchronized all 100+ forked repositories with upstream
- Merged 1000+ open PRs across all forks
- Updated all Momentum Firmware submodules to latest versions
- Disabled GitHub Actions across all forks for optimization

### Breaking Changes:
- OFW: JS: SDK 1.0:
  - Scripts using these modules will need to be updated
  - Module `gui/submenu`:
    - The API now takes submenu items as view children, instead of as a view prop
    - Effort required to update scripts using `gui/submenu`: very minimal
  - Module `gui/widget`:
    - The `button` event now returns an object with `key` and `type`, instead of just the key name
    - Effort required to update scripts using `gui/widget`: very minimal
