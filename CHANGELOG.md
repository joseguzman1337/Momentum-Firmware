### Breaking Changes:
- Sub-GHz: Removed Weather Station, POCSAG and TPMS protocols from main app, now found in external apps (by @WillyJL)
  - Momentum previously supported these external app's protocols in the main Sub-GHz app
  - However, with more protocols added over time to the main app, they are now too many
  - The Flipper CPU cannot keep up with all the data received with this number of protocols in some modulations
  - This caused some signals to not be received when they should, and in some cases could freeze the device
  - Since Weather Station, POCSAG and TPMS are available as external apps, they're now removed from the main Sub-GHz app
  - You can now find this functionality in `Apps > Sub-GHz`, where there are dedicated apps for these 3 functions
