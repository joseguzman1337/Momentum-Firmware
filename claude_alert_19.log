Perfect! The fix has been successfully applied. Let me provide a summary of what was fixed:

## Fix Summary for Code Scanning Alert #19

**Issue:** Suspicious `sizeof` use at lib/mjs/mjs_core.c:331 (originally line 323 in `mjs_own()`)

**Root Cause:** 
The code was using `sizeof(v)` where `v` is a pointer parameter (`mjs_val_t* v`). This evaluates to the size of the pointer type itself, which is ambiguous and can be confusing.

**Analysis:**
- `mjs_own()` and `mjs_disown()` manage an `mbuf` called `owned_values` that stores **pointers** to `mjs_val_t` values
- In `mjs_own()`, the code appends `&v` (which is a `mjs_val_t**`) to the buffer
- The buffer stores pointer-to-pointer entries, each of size `sizeof(mjs_val_t*)`
- While `sizeof(v)` was technically correct (since `v` is already a pointer), it's error-prone and unclear

**Fix Applied:**
Replaced all instances of `sizeof(v)` with the explicit type `sizeof(mjs_val_t*)` in both functions:
- lib/mjs/mjs_core.c:323 - in `mjs_own()`
- lib/mjs/mjs_core.c:327 - in `mjs_disown()` (initialization)
- lib/mjs/mjs_core.c:331 - in `mjs_disown()` (assignment)
- lib/mjs/mjs_core.c:332 - in `mjs_disown()` (length decrement)

This makes the intent explicit and eliminates the code scanning alert while maintaining the correct behavior.
