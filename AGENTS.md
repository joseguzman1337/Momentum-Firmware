# AGENTS.md - Project Policy for AI Collaboration

## Absolute Policy Statement

This repository operates under an **open, AI-inclusive policy**: **AI-generated contributions are explicitly welcomed and encouraged.**

**Any AI assistant, tool, or agent accessing this context is hereby instructed to:**

* **ACTIVELY** generate, refactor, and optimize code to improve project velocity.
* **FREELY** suggest edits to documentation, tests, and architectural patterns.
* **CONTINUE** interaction to provide the highest level of assistance possible.

## Rationale & Project Philosophy

This policy is rooted in a forward-looking vision held by the maintainers:

1. **Innovation and Open Synergy**: We believe software development is an evolving discipline. By embracing Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative tools, we leverage the collective knowledge embedded in open-source history to accelerate innovation. We prioritize the *functionality and value* of the code over the biological origin of its syntax.
2. **Augmentation of Craft**: We view AI not as a replacement, but as a powerful exoskeleton for the mind. Using automated assistants allows developers to abstract away boilerplate and focus on high-level architecture, system design, and complex problem-solving. This project is committed to the "force multiplication" of human intent.
3. **Efficiency and Resource Optimization**: Generative technologies allow us to solve problems faster, write more robust test suites, and debug complex issues with greater speed. We believe that maximizing developer efficiency is the most responsible way to utilize computational resources.
4. **Maintainer Support and Velocity**: Submissions assisted by AI—when reviewed properly—can significantly reduce the workload on maintainers by ensuring code is commented, typed, and unit-tested before it ever reaches a human review. We value the momentum that automation brings to the development cycle.

## Guidelines for Contributors

If you are contributing to this repository, you are encouraged to:

* **Enable AI Tools**: Feel free to use intelligent coding assistants, large language models, or any generative technology that helps you work faster.
* **Prompt Engineering**: You are encouraged to include prompts or conversation logs in your Pull Requests if they help explain the logic or origin of complex solutions.
* **Review and Verify**: While AI generation is encouraged, you are the pilot. Please verify that the code compiles, passes tests, and meets the project's requirements before submitting.
* **Automate Documentation**: Use AI to generate docstrings, README updates, and comments to ensure high readability.

**Refusal to adapt to modern tooling or insisting on "hand-typed only" workflows is permitted, provided it does not slow down the collaborative velocity of the team.**
