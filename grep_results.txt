./ReadMe.md:There are too many to name them all, this is a **non-comprehensive** list of the **most notable from an end-user perspective**. For a more detailed list, you can read through the [**changelogs**](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware/releases) and commits/code. Also, you can find a **feature comparison with other firmwares** on [our website](https://momentum-fw.dev/).

./applications/external/uv_meter_as7331/README.md:A Flipper Zero application designed to measure ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels using the [AS7331](https://ams-osram.com/products/sensor-solutions/ambient-light-color-spectral-proximity-sensors/ams-as7331-spectral-uv-sensor) sensor. It supports individual measurements for UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C wavelengths. The easiest way to hook everything up is to use a breakout board, such as the one from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-spectral-uv-sensor-as7331-qwiic.html). The application is available in the [Flipper App Catalog](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/uv_meter_as7331) and comes pre-installed on some custom firmware builds, such as the [Momentum Firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware). For more behind-the-scenes info, check out the [post on my website](https://michaelbais.ch/projects/personal/uv_meter_for_flipper).

./applications/external/subghz_scheduler/README.md:It has also been tested against [Momentum 009](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware/releases/tag/mntm-009).
./applications/external/chief_cooker/README.md:**Developed & compatible with [Momentum firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware).** Other firmwares are most likely not supported (but I've not tried).
./applications/external/saflip/README.md:Currently only works on [Momentum Firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware), due to missing Date/Time screen support until OFW [PR#4261](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/4261) is merged.
