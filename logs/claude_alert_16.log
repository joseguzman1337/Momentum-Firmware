Excellent! The fix has been successfully applied. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Fixed Code Scanning Alert #16: Array offset used before range check

**Location:** `applications/services/gui/elements.c:928`

**Issue:** The code was accessing `line[i].text[j]` before performing the bounds check `j < line[i].len - 1`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the array access happened before the boundary validation.

**Vulnerability Details:**
- **Type:** CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)
- **Severity:** High
- **Risk:** Potential segmentation fault or reading beyond buffer boundaries

**Fix Applied:**
Changed the condition order from:
```c
if(line[i].text[j] == '\e' && j < line[i].len - 1)
```

To:
```c
if(j < line[i].len - 1 && line[i].text[j] == '\e')
```

**Security Improvement:**
By reordering the conditions to check the bounds FIRST (`j < line[i].len - 1`) before accessing the array element (`line[i].text[j]`), we leverage C's short-circuit evaluation. This ensures that if `j` is out of bounds, the second condition (array access) is never evaluated, preventing potential out-of-bounds reads.

The fix is minimal, non-invasive, and maintains the exact same logical behavior while eliminating the security vulnerability.
