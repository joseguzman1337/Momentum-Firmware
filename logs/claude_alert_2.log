Perfect! I've successfully fixed the arbitrary file write vulnerability in `scripts/wifi_board.py` at line 115.

## Summary of the Fix

**Vulnerability**: The code was using `tar.extractall()` directly without validating the archive contents, which could allow path traversal attacks through malicious tar files containing:
- Absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- Relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../../sensitive_file`)

**Secure Fix Applied** (scripts/wifi_board.py:115-128):
1. **Path validation function** (`is_within_directory`): Checks if the extraction target path is within the intended extraction directory using absolute path comparison
2. **Safe extraction wrapper** (`safe_extract`): Validates all tar members before extraction to prevent path traversal
3. **Error handling**: Raises an exception if any member attempts to escape the target directory

This fix ensures that even if a malicious tar archive is downloaded from a compromised or untrusted source, it cannot write files outside the designated `target_dir`, preventing arbitrary file write attacks.
