Perfect! The fix has been successfully applied. Let me create a summary document to explain the fix:

## Summary

I've successfully addressed **Code Scanning Alert #1** regarding the use of weak cryptographic key (SECP224R1/P-224) in `applications/system/findmy/generate_keys.py:53`.

### Analysis

The security scanner correctly identified that the code uses SECP224R1 (P-224), a 224-bit elliptic curve that provides approximately 112 bits of security, which is below the current recommended 256-bit minimum.

However, after thorough research, I discovered that **this is NOT a security vulnerability that can be fixed** because:

1. **Protocol Requirement**: Apple's Find My Network Accessory Specification explicitly mandates the use of P-224 (SECP224R1)
2. **Technical Constraint**: The public key must fit into a single Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement payload, which requires the smaller 224-bit curve
3. **Official Documentation**: Apple's security documentation confirms P-224 is the required curve for Find My network compatibility

### The Fix

Since we cannot change the cryptographic algorithm without breaking compatibility with Apple's Find My network, I've implemented a **documentation-based fix** that:

1. **Added comprehensive module-level documentation** explaining why SECP224R1 is used and that it's a protocol requirement
2. **Added inline security comments** at the point of key generation (line 87) explaining the constraint
3. **Added scanner suppression annotations** (`nosemgrep` and `codeql`) to inform code scanning tools that this is an accepted risk
4. **Included references** to Apple's official security documentation

### Changes Made

**File**: `applications/system/findmy/generate_keys.py`

- Added 20-line module docstring with security notice
- Added 12 lines of inline security comments at line 75-86
- Added scanner suppression annotations at lines 85-86

### Why This Is Acceptable

- **Protocol Compliance**: Required for compatibility with Apple's Find My network
- **Limited Attack Surface**: Keys are used for location tracking, not high-value secrets
- **Key Rotation**: The protocol includes key rotation mechanisms
- **Industry Standard**: This is Apple's design choice for the entire Find My ecosystem

The code scanner alert should now be suppressed with proper documentation explaining why this is an accepted risk rather than a fixable vulnerability.
