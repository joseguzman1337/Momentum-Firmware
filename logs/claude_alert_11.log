Based on my analysis, I need to provide you with important context about this security alert:

## Security Analysis: This is a FALSE POSITIVE

**The Issue:**
The code scanning tool flagged the use of 3DES (Triple DES) encryption as a "broken or weak cryptographic algorithm."

**Why This is NOT a Security Vulnerability:**

1. **Hardware Protocol Requirement**: This code implements the **Mifare Ultralight C authentication protocol**, which is defined by NXP Semiconductors' ISO/IEC 14443 specification. The Mifare Ultralight C card **mandates 3DES** as part of its authentication mechanism.

2. **Emulation Context**: This is part of the Flipper Zero firmware that **emulates NFC cards**. To properly emulate a Mifare Ultralight C card and communicate with real NFC readers, the firmware **must** use 3DES - there is no alternative.

3. **No Data at Risk**: The 3DES usage is limited to:
   - Challenge-response authentication handshake between card and reader
   - Short-lived session authentication (random nonces)
   - NOT used for encrypting user data or long-term secrets

4. **Cannot Be Changed**: Using AES or another modern algorithm would:
   - Break compatibility with real Mifare Ultralight C readers
   - Make the emulation non-functional
   - Violate the NFC protocol specification

**Recommendation:**

The appropriate fix is to **document why 3DES is required** and **suppress this specific warning** using code annotations. This is a case where the security scanner doesn't understand the hardware/protocol constraints.

Would you like me to:
1. **Add documentation comments** explaining the protocol requirement (RECOMMENDED)
2. **Add a suppression annotation** to silence the false positive
3. **Create a security exception document** explaining why this is acceptable

This is similar to implementing SSL/TLS libraries - you must support older cipher suites for backward compatibility, even though they're considered weak by modern standards.

What would you like me to do?
