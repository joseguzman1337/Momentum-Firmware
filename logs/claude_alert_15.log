Perfect! I've successfully fixed Code Scanning Alert #15.

## Summary

**Issue**: Buffer overflow vulnerability at line 136 in `ble_beacon_app.c`

**Root Cause**: The `while` loop was accessing `app->beacon_data[app->beacon_data_len]` **before** checking if `app->beacon_data_len < sizeof(app->beacon_data)`, which could lead to out-of-bounds array access.

**Fix Applied**: Reordered the condition in the while loop to perform the bounds check first:

**Before** (lines 136-138):
```c
while((app->beacon_data[app->beacon_data_len] != 0) &&
      (app->beacon_data_len < sizeof(app->beacon_data))) {
```

**After** (lines 136-137):
```c
while((app->beacon_data_len < sizeof(app->beacon_data)) &&
      (app->beacon_data[app->beacon_data_len] != 0)) {
```

This ensures the array index is validated before it's used, preventing potential buffer overflow. The fix leverages C's short-circuit evaluation of the `&&` operator - if the first condition fails, the second condition (which accesses the array) won't be evaluated.

The change is located at `applications/examples/example_ble_beacon/ble_beacon_app.c:136-137`.
