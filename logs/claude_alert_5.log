Excellent! The fix has been successfully applied. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed **Code Scanning Alert #5**: Non-constant format string vulnerability in `applications/main/nfc/scenes/nfc_scene_des_auth_unlock_warn.c` at line 30.

### The Problem
The code was passing a dynamically constructed string (containing hex-formatted key data) directly as the format string parameter to `nfc_text_store_set()`:
```c
nfc_text_store_set(nfc, furi_string_get_cstr(str));
```

Since `nfc_text_store_set()` uses `vsnprintf()` internally with variadic arguments, this created a format string vulnerability. If the dynamic string contained format specifiers (like `%s`, `%x`, `%n`, etc.), they would be interpreted as format directives rather than literal text, potentially leading to:
- Information disclosure
- Memory corruption
- Denial of service

### The Fix
Changed line 30 to use a constant format string `"%s"` with the dynamic string as an argument:
```c
nfc_text_store_set(nfc, "%s", furi_string_get_cstr(str));
```

This ensures that the dynamic content is treated as data, not as a format string, preventing any format string interpretation vulnerabilities.

### Security Impact
This fix eliminates the format string vulnerability and ensures that the key data (even if it somehow contained `%` characters) is safely displayed as literal text without being interpreted as format specifiers.
